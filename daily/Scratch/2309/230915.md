(Distributed systems and data processing) Object storage product
> Object storage solutions are designed to store unstructured information and object files. Object files contain data, metadata, and individual identifiers. These files are highly customizable, durable, and rich in data. Companies use object storage software to house various files, such as static content, media, and data backups in the form of objects. These storage systems are less scalable than [block storage software](https://www.g2.com/categories/block-storage), but better facilitate operations requiring significant metadata access.

ACID: Atomicity Consistency Isolation Durability

- **Atomicity** - each statement in a transaction (to read, write, update or delete data) is treated as a single unit. Either the entire statement is executed, or none of it is executed. This property prevents data loss and corruption from occurring if, for example, if your streaming data source fails mid-stream.
- **Consistency** - ensures that transactions only make changes to tables in predefined, predictable ways. Transactional consistency ensures that corruption or errors in your data do not create unintended consequences for the integrity of your table.
- **Isolation** - when multiple users are reading and writing from the same table all at once, isolation of their transactions ensures that the concurrent transactions don't interfere with or affect one another. Each request can occur as though they were occurring one by one, even though they're actually occurring simultaneously.
- **Durability** - ensures that changes to your data made by successfully executed transactions will be saved, even in the event of system failure.
