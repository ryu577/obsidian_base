Interview today went well since I was actually asked some coding. Didn't ask me to write code, just whiteboard on the surface was fine. The surface and screen sharing really helped express ideas.

- Two binary search trees. Print all the nodes that are common.
	- If a number is repeated twice in both trees, print it twice.
- Do an in-order traversal of the smaller tree. This will return the keys in sorted order.
- Use the two pointer method (similar to merge sort). Sort both arrays. Then move the first index until >= second. Then move second until >= first. Whenever they match exactly, print.
	- To extend this idea to the trees, we need to loop through them in sorted order (inorder traversal) and then be able to pause the iteration.

- [ ] Applications of pre-order and post-order traversal.
	- When copying a tree, we want to start with root and go downward from there. Hence, pre-order.
	- When deleting a tree, we want to delete the leaves first and make our way upwards. Hence, post-order.
- [ ] Binary search where if there are duplicates, earliest index is always returned. And, one where latest index is always returned.
- [ ] Traversing a tree in-order iteratively and not recursively. With an explicit stack instead of an implicit one.
