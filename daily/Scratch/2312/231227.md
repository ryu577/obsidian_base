# Stable diffusion
Course content on how stable diffusion works.
Its very heavy on probability theory.

Diffusion models are like a time machine. Gradually remove (and modify) pixels from a complete random noise picture.

Why diffusion?
https://ai.stackexchange.com/questions/40057/whats-the-benefit-of-diffusion-models-reverse-process



InÂ [probability theory](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Probability_theory "Probability theory")Â andÂ [statistics](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Statistics "Statistics"),Â **diffusion processes**Â are a class of continuous-timeÂ [Markov process](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Markov_process "Markov process")Â withÂ [almost surely](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Almost_surely "Almost surely")Â [continuous](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Continuous_function "Continuous function")Â sample paths. Diffusion process is stochastic in nature and hence is used to model many real-life stochastic systems.Â [Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Brownian_motion "Brownian motion"),Â [reflected Brownian motion](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Reflected_Brownian_motion "Reflected Brownian motion")Â andÂ [Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck processes](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Ornstein%E2%80%93Uhlenbeck_processes "Ornsteinâ€“Uhlenbeck processes")Â are examples of diffusion processes.

So diffusion processes are continuous time Markov chains.

## What I know so far
- They use diffusion to convert one distribution to another in steps.
	- This is equivalent to the blurry images we see in midjourney before the final product.
- They use a Markov chain with some number of discrete steps that converts one distribution into the other.
- All possible images form some space. Actual images occurring in the real world form some "cloud" in this space. The diffusion process perturbs the cloud so that its indistinguishable from a Gaussian.
	- The reverse diffusion process is what makes the images. This is what we see unfold in the discord prompts.


## Paper summary
- Goal: define a forward (or inference) diffusion pro- cess which converts any complex data distribution into a simple, tractable, distribution, and then learn a finite-time reversal of this diffusion process.
- A related idea is "Annealed importance sampling".
	- Uses a Markov chain which slowly converts one distribution into another to compute a ratio of normalizing constants.
- Gaussian diffusion process which has any target distribution as its equilibrium.
	- Langevin dynamics (Langevin, 1908), which are the stochastic realization of the Fokker-Planck equation show this.
- The Kolmogorov forward and backward equations (Feller, 1949) show that for many forward diffusion processes, the reverse diffusion processes can be described using the same functional form.
	- There is a lot of talk of "forward backward" from continuous time Markov chains.
	- Markov diffusion kernel.
### Diffusion

From: https://scholar.harvard.edu/files/schwartz/files/2-diffusion.pdf very physics heavy.

If you we put a drop of red dye in water, it will slowly diuse throughout the water. Why does this happen? How fast does it happen? What is going on microscopically?

The microscopic mechanism of diffusion is very simple: the dye molecules start densely concentrated near one point. Then they get bumped by neighboring molecules until they are spread out all over.

- Diffusion is closely related to random walks.

### Diffusion model
https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Diffusion_model
A diffusion model consists of three major components: the forward process, the reverse process, and the sampling procedure.

Involves training a neural network to sequentiallyÂ [denoise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Denoise "Denoise")Â images blurred withÂ [Gaussian noise](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Gaussian_noise "Gaussian noise").

The model is trained to reverse the process of adding noise to an image.

It can be used for image generation by starting with an image composed of random noise for the network to iteratively denoise.

[DALL-E 2](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/DALL-E_2 "DALL-E 2")Â is an example that uses diffusion models for both the model's prior (which produces an image embedding given a text caption) and the decoder that generates the final image.

Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM). Involves a neural network.
### Lingo
- Markov diffusion kernel.
- Annealed importance sampling.
- A "binomial diffusion model".
- Denoising Diffusion Probabilistic Model (DDPM)
	- Variational inference.

# Questions
- [ ] Why do we need forward and backward diffusion processes? Why convert to Gaussian?
- [ ] What role do the prompts play in the model? How is that input taken? How is the training data accounted for?
- [ ] How do neural networks tie into the reverse diffusion process?
