#### A-1) Determinants for all matrices?

In point number 5 of section I we mentioned that the notion of the determinant applies only to square matrices (_n⨉n_), or linear maps whose input and output vector spaces have the same dimensionalities (_n_). But why can’t we extend this to rectangular matrices?

For a rectangular matrix (_n⨉m_), we could also think of the ratio of measures after vs before. As a concrete example, consider a _3⨉2_ matrix, _A_ (the entries are real numbers). This matrix takes vectors from the two dimensional space, _V:= R²_and maps them to vectors from the three dimensional space, _W:= R³_. We could take two vectors from _V._ These vectors contain between them some area, _A1_. After we apply the linear transform to both these vectors, we get two three dimensional vectors in _W_. These two vectors also contain between them some area, _A2_. So why can’t we call the ratio, _r=A2/A1_ the determinant?

This ratio would not be independent of our choice of the initial two vectors, so this isn’t an exclusive property of the linear map.

  

  

1. Chapter-2: We wanted to quantify the effect a linear map has on the vector spaces it operates on. The only way we found was to take the volume of any n-dimensional patch of space and take the ratio of the measure (volume) of that patch after the linear map acts on it to the measure before.
2. The ratio defined above is a great way to quantify the effect of linear maps because it doesn’t depend on the specific patch of space we choose for the linear map to act on. So, it is an exclusive property of the linear maps and we call it a determinant.
3. The determinant defined in this way only applies to linear maps whose input and output vector spaces are the same (_f: V -> V_). These kinds of maps are called endomorphisms. All the matrices corresponding to a map like this will be square matrices.
4. For linear maps that aren’t endomorphisms (so the matrices are rectangular with the number of rows, _n_ not equal to the number of columns, _m_), there is no such property as the determinant. Why can’t we extend the definition? If the determinant is the ratio of the areas after vs before, why can’t the same concept apply? The short answer is that such a ratio depends on the initial vectors and not exclusively on the linear map. For the long answer, see section
5. It so happens that to calculate the determinant of a linear transformation (that is an endomorphism), we can take any one of the matrices (_n⨉n_) it corresponds to. Then, calculate the n-dimensional volume contained between the _n_column vectors. Or, we can do the same thing with the _n_ row vectors and get the same result. This is easy to see with the Leibniz formula covered in section ?? of chapter-2.

Geometrically, this is visualized in the figure below for three dimensional space (_n=3_). The three column vectors of the matrix form an irregular Tetrahedron. The volume of the Tetrahedron is (it turns out) half the determinant of the matrix and its linear map.
