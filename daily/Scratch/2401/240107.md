## Soln
Let $S_n$ denote the number of subscribers in month $n$, which is also the total payments received in month $n$. Now, out of $S_n$ subscribers, the number of subscribers next month is a Binomial r.v. with parameter $1-q$ and consequently, the expected number of subscribers next month given $S_n$ is
$$E[S_{n+1}|S_n] = (1-q)S_n + p $$
where $p$ appears because independent of $S_n$, the expected number of additional subscriber is $p$. 

Using the law of iterated expectations,
$$E[S_{n+1}] = E[E[S_{n+1}|S_n]] = E[(1-q)S_n + p] = (1-q)E[S_n] + p $$
So this gives us a recursion. Since $E[S_1] = p$, we find

$$\begin{align*}
E[S_2]&= (1-q)p+p = [1+(1-q)]p\\
E[S_3]&= (1-q)[[1+(1-q)]p]+p = [1+(1-q)+(1-q)^2]p\\
\vdots&\\
E[S_n]&= [1+(1-q)+(1-q)^2+\cdots+(1-q)^{n-1}]p = \frac{1-(1-q)^n}{q}p
\end{align*}$$

Therefore, in the long run, as $n\to \infty$, the expected number of subscribers (thus expected revenue) will be  
$$E[S_{\infty}] = \frac{1}{1-(1-q)}p = \frac{p}{q} $$
And as you claimed, this number increases unboundedly as $q\to 0$.
