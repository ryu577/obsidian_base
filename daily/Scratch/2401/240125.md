# TODO
- Blog on linear algebra.
	- [ ] Understand proof of rank nullity.
	- [ ] Write section on rank nullity thm.
- Steve Balmer's interview question on binary search game. I think of a number between 1 and 100. You choose a number, I tell you less than or greater than. First chance means 5 dollars, next is 4 dollars and so on. Goes negative.
	- [ ] Prove that the number of comparisons in the worst case is 6.
	- [ ] For perfectly random, what is the expected value of the game?

## Wrk
- Write design of excluding WL plus signal #tech/azure  
	- Simple mask. 
- Write one-pager on AzQualify vision.
	- Integration testing might describe some of what we do, but doesn't describe everything we do. A/B testing does.
	- Integration testing doesn't require a data science team to support. A/B testing does.
	- Integration testing doesn't require volume. for simple diversity, 50 nodes is enough.
	- Integration testing aims to catch deterministic issues. A/B testing aims to catch stochastic issues.
- [ ] Start thread with Nikhil and Naveen on VfpAgent builds.
## Reading
- How RELU is used in neural networks.
- Variational neural networks.

## Tutoring
- Variational inference model vs estimating params of distribution.
	- P-scores will be computationally hard.
	- Forced to use simulation.
		- But then, "luck rises" effect.
	- Output result can be any real number. Don't know what its distribution is.
