Trying to get Obsidian on my windows machine now. Since the entire vault is very small by design, I can just copy the whole thing to a thumb drive and move it between Windows and mac. 

Math works great here thanks to MathJax. Let's say $f(x)$ is the function I want to write. I can also write a matrix like so:


$$
\left[\begin{matrix}  
1 & 2 & 3\\  
a & b & c  
\end{matrix}\right]
$$

This is pretty awesome. 

And let's make a change now and see if it syncs (installed icloud drive on Windows here). Wow, it synced almost instantaneously!

Worst case, the thumb drive option always works.

Let's now try to link the other page inline:

![[obsd_how#Daily thoughts]]

What if there is an embedding within an embedding within an embedding and so on?

Here is how to use the dataview to create queries.

```dataview
TABLE file.tags as tags
FROM "daily"
```


```query
#math #blog 
```
