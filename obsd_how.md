# Daily thoughts

Got exposed to Obsidian from a Youtube video.
Manan Khurma had also posted on LinkedIn how it was a second brain.

I like the idea of this being a management system that makes finding files easy.

I also like that I can just save files with handwriting as PNG images and compress them really small.

# Images
The images can be linked in these .md files like so:

![[EquiAngular.png#invert | 200]]

Each image can be compressed to less than 100KB.

If I generate one of these images every single day, then it'll take 10,000 days for the size of the vault to become 1GB. That's ~30 years!
