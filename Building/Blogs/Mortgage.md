$a$: Principal remaining.
$t$: Number of periods.
$u$: Due per period.

| Interest | Principal | Total |  
| -------- | -------- | -------- |  
| $ar$ | $u-ar$ | $u$ |  
| $(a-(u-ar))r$ | $u-(a-(u-ar))r = (u-ar)(1+r)$ | $u$ |


Principal paid in period $i$ becomes: $(u-ar)(1+r)^{i-1}$
$$\sum\limits_{i=1}^t (u-ar)(1+r)^{i-1} = a$$
$$(u-ar)\left(\frac{(1+r)^t-1}{r}\right) = a$$
# If t is fixed
$$u-ar = \frac{ar}{(1+r)^t-1}$$
$$u = ar\left(\frac{(1+r)^t}{(1+r)^t-1}\right) = \frac{ar}{1-(1+r)^{-t}}\tag{1}$$
# If u is fixed
$$(a+r)^t-1 = \frac{ar}{u-ar}$$
$$(1+r)^t = \frac{u}{u-ar}$$
$$t = \log_{1+r}\left(\frac{u}{u-ar}\right)$$
# Frequent compounding
If we compound $x$ times:
$$\left(\frac{u}{x}-\frac{ar}{x}\right)\left(\frac{\left(1+\frac{r}{x}\right)^{t_1}-1}{\frac{r}{x}}\right)$$
$u$ is given by equation (1)

$$\left(1+\frac{r}{x}\right)^{t_1}=\frac{u}{u-ar}$$
$$t_1 = \log_{\left(1+\frac{r}{x}\right)}\left(\frac{u}{u-ar}\right)$$
$$=\log_{\left(1+\frac{r}{x}\right)}\left(\frac{\left(\frac{ar}{1-(1+r)^{-t}}\right)}{\frac{ar}{1-(1+r)^{-t}}-ar}\right)$$

1. Making informed decisions: Mortgages involve complex calculations like interest rates, loan terms, and monthly payments. Grasping these concepts empowers you to compare different loan options, understand the true cost of borrowing, and choose the mortgage that best suits your financial situation. Imagine it like navigating a financial jungle — proper math skills are your machete, helping you blaze a path towards the most advantageous loan.

2. Avoiding financial pitfalls: Blindly trusting loan officers or online calculators can be risky. By understanding the math, you can independently verify calculations, identify hidden fees, and avoid predatory lending practices. It’s like having a financial X-ray vision, allowing you to see through the fine print and make informed decisions that protect your long-term financial health.

3. Building financial resilience: Mortgages are long-term commitments. Knowing how interest accrues, how principal payments affect your balance, and how unexpected events like rising interest rates can impact your payments empowers you to plan ahead, adjust your budget accordingly, and weather financial storms with greater confidence. It’s like building a sturdy financial house — the math lays the foundation for a secure and stable future.

1. Data Analysis and Interpretation:

- Financial data processing: Mortgages generate a wealth of financial data, including loan terms, payments, interest rates, and property values. Skills in data cleaning, wrangling, and analysis, honed through understanding mortgage math, can be readily applied to other data sets in AI and ML.
- Statistical modeling: Analyzing mortgage data often involves regressions, time series analysis, and probability calculations — core statistical skills used extensively in building and evaluating AI and ML models.
- Feature engineering: Extracting meaningful features from financial data like payment history, credit score, or property characteristics forms the backbone of many AI and ML applications. Skills in identifying and manipulating relevant variables developed through mortgage analysis can be transferred to other domains.

2. Risk Assessment and Prediction:

- Machine learning for credit scoring: Understanding how lenders use statistical models to assess credit risk and predict loan defaults can offer valuable insights into building similar models for various applications in AI and ML.
- Forecasting and optimization: Predicting future outcomes like interest rate changes or house price fluctuations requires skills in data analysis and modeling used in AI and ML for tasks like time series forecasting or optimization problems.
- Decision-making under uncertainty: Mortgages involve navigating uncertainty around future financial situations. This experience in building models and making decisions with incomplete information translates well to various AI and ML domains where probabilistic reasoning and risk assessment are crucial.

3. Algorithmic Efficiency and Explainability:

- Understanding computational complexity: Analyzing mortgage calculations like compound interest or amortization involves understanding basic computational concepts like loops and recursion. These core principles are essential for optimizing algorithms and ensuring efficient processing in AI and ML applications.
- Model interpretability: Building interpretable models that explain their reasoning is crucial in many AI and ML applications. The logic and structure of mortgage models, often based on linear relationships and clear financial principles, can serve as a starting point for designing interpretable models in other domains.

Ultimately, understanding the math of your mortgage not only empowers you to manage your finances but also equips you with fundamental skills and knowledge applicable to the exciting world of AI, ML, and data science. It teaches you how to analyze and interpret data, build statistical models, predict outcomes, and make informed decisions under uncertainty — all of which are essential for navigating the data-driven future.
