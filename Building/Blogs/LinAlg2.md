### II) Matrix addition

Addition is defined on scalars and vectors that belong to the same space. There is only one natural definition on linear maps and their corresponding matrices. The linear map, _L_ that is the sum of two linear maps, _L_1_ and _L_2_ corresponds to 

- Distributive property of addition.
- (a+b).c = a.c + b.c

### III) Matrix multiplication

For scalars, multiplication is baked into the definition (since they are fields and multiplication being defined is a pre-requisite for something being one). For vectors, 

- Dot product on vectors (applicable to any space).
- (a.b).c = a.(b.c)
- Commutative property is violated.
- Associativity is not violated.

### IV) Matrix inversion: extension of division

#### IV-A) LUP decomposition

- TODO: Python code for LUP decomposition.

#### IV-B) Linear regression: pseudo inverse
